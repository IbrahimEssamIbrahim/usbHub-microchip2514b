# usbHub-microchip2514b
A while ago, I purchased a new laptop with impressive performance capabilities. However, I encountered an issue with the limited number of ports it supported. As a result, I began searching for a high-quality USB hub, also known as a dongle. During my search, I became a bit curious about how these devices operate, their internal components, and, most importantly, what it would entail to design one myself.
 
After doing some research, I stumbled upon the USB251xB chips, which belong to the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed (480Mbps) hub controller family manufactured by Microchip Technology. These hub controllers are specifically designed to offer USB connectivity and hub functionality to a wide range of electronic devices, including laptops, desktop computers, embedded systems, and more. They are available in various configurations, each offering a different number of downstream USB ports. The 'x' in USB251xB denotes the specific number of ports available in a particular variant (e.g., USB2512B has 2 ports, USB2514B has 4 ports).
 
I found the USB2514B to be the most suitable chip for my design, as it provides an adequate number of ports for my needs. As a starting point for PCB layout, I referred to the designs and application notes provided in the datasheet. I’ve tried as much as possible to follow recommended component placement, power and ground plans, and routing considerations, particularly for the differential pairs associated with USB data lines (D+ and D-). This was done to maintain consistent trace lengths and minimize skew.
 
Additionally, I came across several videos on the Phil’s Lab YouTube channel, which proved me with very helpful information to refining my final design.
 
Here are the specifications of the product:
* connects to the host via a micro-USB-B 2.0 port and provides 4 USB ports.
* Includes USB protection to safeguard against static discharges.
* Can supply up to 500mA of current to connected devices.
* Supports an external 5V-DC power jack for added versatility.
 
 Once I was satisfied with the PCB design, I created a case for the USB hub with fusion 360 that could be 3D printed.
